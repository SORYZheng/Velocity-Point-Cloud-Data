We kindly request your assistance in translating all labels in the above documents into your native language. Reading them in your own language will help you to understand them better.

Due to the considerable storage space required for the dataset, it is stored at https://www.aliyundrive.com/drive/album. We would like to kindly direct you to the Aliyundrive account. The account of the aliyundrive: 13303808613; PINï¼šHSBRD12. 

Radar data collected by distributed radar sensor systems. The behaviors included are as follows: falling, getting up after falling, squatting, getting up after squatting, bending, getting up after bending, sitting down, and getting up after sitting down.

The dataset is described in detail in our paper (P. Zheng, A. Zhang, J. Chen, J. Zhang and F. Qi, "Direction-Independent Human Behavior Recognition Using Distributed Radar Sensor System and Hybrid Neural Network With Dual-View Attention," in IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 24, no. 24, pp. 41288-41300, 15 Dec.15, 2024, doi: 10.1109/JSEN.2024.3482291.).

You can use 'VExtractData.m' to extract velocity point cloud maps.
